The window of **Figure 10** appears after the first window when the selected folder contains subfolders with images matching the *Image prefix* and *Images extension* patterns.  

Here, the user can:  
- Adjust the number of arenas for each folder  
- Select which folders to analyze (use `Ctrl/Cmd + Click` for multi-selection)  

Click **Next** to go to the image analysis window (Fig. 2) of the first selected folder.

## Notes

- If the *Select and draw* option is required for more than one folder, analyze them separately.  
  → In that case, click *Previous* and select only one subfolder.  

- If only one folder requires the *Select and draw* option, analyze it first.  
  → To do so, deselect all folders, select the one that needs drawing, then hold `Ctrl/Cmd` while selecting the others.  

- If the first selected folder has already been analyzed, two shortcuts appear:  
  - **Video analysis window** → skips the image analysis window, lets the user tune video tracking before running all  
  - **Run all directly** → skips both image analysis and video tracking, applies saved settings to all folders directly
