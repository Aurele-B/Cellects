# What is Cellects?


## Purpose
Cellects analyzes organisms that grow or move on an immobile surface.

## To generate usable data
Cellects allows you to analyze timelapses in the form of a set of images or a video. 
To work properly, these timelapses must be taken with a camera capturing specimen(s) in one or several stationary arena(s). Arena's position and illumination conditions have to remain constant throughout the experiment.
Then, run the software and help it find the location of the timelapse (see [Data localisation](first-analysis/data-localisation.md)).

## User guide description
<div style="text-align: justify">
In the first section of this user manual, we will explain how to set up a first quick analysis with Cellects. 
Any Cellects analysis takes place in 3 steps: data specification, first image analysis and video tracking. 
The second section of this user manual runs thoroughly through every option to run Cellects in particular conditions 
and to finetune an already working setup.
