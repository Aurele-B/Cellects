Cellects User Manual
====================

Foreword
--------
<div style="text-align: justify">
Cellects analyzes organisms that grow or move on an immobile surface. In the first section of this user manual, we will explain how to set up a first quick analysis with Cellects. Any Cellects analysis takes place in 3 steps: data specification, first image analysis and video tracking. The second section of this user manual runs thoroughly through every option to run Cellects in particular conditions and to finetune an already working setup.
